## Getting Started

### What is CSS?

**CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML.  
It defines how elements should be rendered on screen, paper, speech, or other media.

### How CSS Works

CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them.  
The **"cascading"** part refers to how styles can **inherit** and **override** each other based on specificity and order.

### Setting Up

To begin with CSS, you need:

- Clone or download this repository : `git clone https://github.com/srjingole0610/CSS.git`
- A text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, Notepad, etc.)
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of HTML
